# Sterra Wiki (v2.2)
## ðŸŽŠ Welcome to Sterra's Wiki
Sterra is a SOCMINT program **helping investigations** on Instagram accounts. It does that by allowing you to **export followers | following | mutuals lists** of your target, **comparing them** with others, and **analyzing them** to find interesting accounts on which investigate further.

This concept has (from my knowledge) **never seen before**, and I hope having the time to extend it to other social medias.
## ðŸ’¡ Usage
```diff
- Sterra is pretty complex to use, follow the basic usage section at first.
- If you need more, check the other wiki pages.
