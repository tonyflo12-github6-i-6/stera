# üë®‚Äçüè´ Exemple of usage
For the example we'll take the instagram account of [Kylie Jenner](https://www.instagram.com/kyliejenner/).
## 1Ô∏è‚É£ First thing to do: export the list.
We will target the following list, for 2 reasons:
- The following are the interests of the target, while the followers are the people interested by the target,
- Because her followers list is too long.
```python
sterra -ssid MY_SESSION_ID -u kyliejenner -t following --express --name kylie_following
```
*`--name` is to custom the filename, i could also in adition use `--path` to precise where i want it to be exported*

### I have my file id (here: `1644250496525407`)
### I can get its path and open it:
```python
sterra history -i 1644250496525407
```

It is located at `/usr/local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/sterra-2.2b0-py3.10.egg/sterra/export/kylie_following.xlsx`

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ I can search for close circle account in the exported list
```python
sterra analyse 1644250496525407 --size 10
```

The first two accounts are the most probable to be in the close circle of the target;
- 75% [sweetboydaniel](https://www.instagram.com/sweetboydaniel/)
- 95% [shellibird1](https://www.instagram.com/shellibird1/)
## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Now i want to see who are followed by Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott
```python
sterra -ssid MY_SESSION_ID -u travisscott -t following --express --name travis_following
```
![](https://i.imgur.com/dKVoJVh.png)
```python
sterra compare 16442509694624581 1644250496525407 --common-usernames --url
```
