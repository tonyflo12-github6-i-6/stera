# üì¶ First steps
Sterra is a tool with a lot of options: It can be hard to learn how to use it. Start by here before heading to the complete Wiki.
## üß© Sterra is divised by the following submodules:
```
EXPORT - COMPARE - ANALYSE - CONVERT - HISTORY
```
Each of them have their job. The most used one is `export`, followed by `analyse` and `compare`.

## To test them, call sterra with command `sterra`.
***
## üì§ `Export` allows you to export list of followers | following | mutuals of an account;
```python
sterra export -ssid SESSIONID -u USERNAME -t TARGET_LIST
# -ssid is your session-id
# -u is the username of you target
# -t is the list you want to get ("followers","following","mutuals" or "both")
```

### At the end you will get a file id, as below:
```pyton
USERNAME's following list exported under id: 16438161339998531
```
This file id will be the id identifing your file (you can also use its path).
***
## üóì To get the path of the file from the id:
```python
sterra history -i YOUR_FILE_ID
```
***
## üë• To check who's close to your target:
_Do this on a list targeting following, it will be more accurate._
```python
sterra analyse YOUR_FILE_ID
```
This will return you something like:
```python
|%| Probabilites for personnal accounts in FILE_PATH:
    %% -> username
    5  -> username
    40 -> username
    45 -> username
    90 -> username
```

***
## üîõ Compare lists
```python
sterra compare FILE_ID ANOTHER_F_ID --common-usernames
```
This will return you the common usernames between these two lists (based on the instagram id, but returns usernames)
