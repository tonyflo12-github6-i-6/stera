# ‚è≥ History module
This module allows you to check path of exported files, id of files, search in the history, and many other functions.
***
### Get all the export history
```python
sterra history -a|--all
```
### Clear the export history
```python
sterra history --clear
```
### Print the tree of a file (for compare):
```python
sterra history --compare-tree {ID|PATH}
```
### Delete parts stored
```python
sterra history --clear-parts
```
### Show the path associated to an id
```python
sterra history -i|--file-id ID
```
### Search for a name in the export history

Match works also with regexes. For this, your string must be enclosed by `?"YOUR_REGEX_HERE"?`
